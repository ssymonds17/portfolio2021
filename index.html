          Hi, I'm <strong>Samuel</strong>, a Full Stack Web Developer born and
          raised in <strong>London</strong>. After 2 years working within the
          tech industry in different capacities, I took the plunge and completed
          both a Web Developer Traineeship with
          <a href="https://itcareerswitch.co.uk/" target="_blank"
            >IT CareerSwitch</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/" target="_blank"
            >CareerFoundry's</a
          >
          Full Stack Web Development course.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating with a BA in <strong>Japanese</strong> from
          <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
            SOAS, University of London</a
          >, I had the opportunity to work for
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/maps/" target="_blank">Apple</a>,
          within their maps department, and a high growth tech startup,
          <a href="https://wheely.com/en" target="_blank">Wheely</a>. At Apple I
          worked as a <strong>bilingual maps analyst</strong> which sparked my
          interest in software and application development. At Wheely my role
          was in <strong>Operations</strong>, working directly with the
          partnering chauffeurs and interacting with data for quality assurance
          purposes.

          I am a huge sports fan so in my spare time I enjoy following a number
          of sports, particular <strong>football</strong> and
          <strong>basketball</strong>. Apart from this I love to indulge in my
          hobby of eating, which leads me to spend many hours in the kitchen at
          home with my friends and family.
