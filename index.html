        Hi, I am <strong>Samuel</strong>, a Full Stack Web Developer born and
        raised in <strong>London</strong>. After 2 years working within the tech
        industry in different capacities, I took the plunge and completed both a
        Web Developer Traineeship with
        <a href="https://itcareerswitch.co.uk/" target="_blank"
          >IT CareerSwitch</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/" target="_blank">CareerFoundry's</a>
        Full Stack Web Development course.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating with a BA in <strong>Japanese</strong> from
        <a href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">
          SOAS, University of London</a
        >, I had the opportunity to work for
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/maps/" target="_blank">Apple</a>,
        within their maps department, and a high growth tech startup,
        <a href="https://wheely.com/en" target="_blank">Wheely</a>. At Apple I
        worked as a <strong>bilingual maps analyst</strong> which sparked my
        interest in software and application development. At Wheely my role was
        in <strong>Operations</strong>, working directly with the partnering
        chauffeurs and interacting with data for quality assurance purposes.

        I am a huge sports fan so in my spare time I enjoy following a number of
        sports, particular <strong>football</strong> and
        <strong>basketball</strong>. Apart from this I love to indulge in my
        hobby of eating, which leads me to spend many hours in the kitchen at
        home with my friends and family.
